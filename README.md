# Circle-Robot
Circular Robot path program making use of the geometric formula of a circle.

The program begins by converting the given arguments into a circle equation.
It then tries to solve for x (the power at which the robot's wheels run) at regular intervals—every 0.1 seconds—thus estimating the path with abstract line segments.

The images below illustrate this process
